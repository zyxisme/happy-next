## Orchestrator

A multi-agent orchestration system that lets you define task dependency graphs and execute them automatically.

- **DAG-based task scheduling**: define tasks with dependencies, Happy resolves execution order and schedules them across agents
- **Per-task model and working directory**: each task can target a specific model and directory
- **Auto-approve flags**: configure automatic approval for orchestrated tasks
- **Session resume for follow-up**: send follow-up messages to completed tasks via session resume
- **Available models API**: `get_context` exposes available models per provider
- **Real-time monitoring**: activity badge with running task count, status-colored progress bars
- **Full app UI**: run list with filter tabs and run counts, run detail page, task detail page
- **Cancel with cascade**: cancelling a run cascades `dependency_failed` to dependent tasks
- **MCP tool integration**: orchestrator tools registered as MCP tools with auto-filled working directory
- **Tool description rewriting**: orchestrator rewrites tool descriptions for better agent comprehension
- **Complete i18n**: all orchestrator UI fully internationalized

## Pending Message Queue

Messages sent while the CLI is busy are now queued and delivered automatically.

- **Server-side pending queue**: messages are queued per-session on the server
- **Auto-dispatch**: queued messages are dispatched to the CLI when it becomes ready
- **Queue panel UI**: view and manage pending messages from the app
- **Image count badge**: pending message preview shows image attachment count
- **Send-now option**: bypass queue and send immediately
- **Reconnect sync**: queue state syncs on WebSocket reconnection
- **Concurrent safety**: hardened dispatch concurrency and cleanup semantics

## Multi-Agent Support

The original Happy only supported Claude Code. Happy Next treats Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini as equal first-class agents.

- **Multi-agent history page** with per-provider tabs (Claude / Codex / Gemini)
- **Session resume and duplicate/fork** for all three agents
- **`/duplicate` slash command**: opens a message picker to fork a session from any point in the conversation, creating a new session with history up to the selected message
- **Per-agent model selection** cached independently, with context window display
- **Cost tracking** with accurate token usage for Claude models (cache tokens, reasoning tokens)
- **Codex reasoning effort** configuration (low / medium / high / xhigh)
- **ACP (Agent Client Protocol) backend** for Codex, replacing the MCP client approach
- **Codex App-Server backend**: alternative `codex app-server` JSON-RPC protocol over stdin/stdout for improved session management and reliability
- **Gemini session persistence** with JSONL storage
- **Per-provider slash commands**: `/clear` for all agents, `/compact` Claude-only
- **Model/mode switching** per session with live metadata sync
- **Codex/Gemini diff processing**: per-file +N/-N statistics displayed in app
- **Message backfill** for Codex and Gemini when resuming/duplicating sessions
- **ACP result format normalization**: Gemini ACP results normalized to match Codex structure
- **Tool ID prefix fallback**: fallback matching for tool IDs with different prefixes
- **Codex v2 protocol fixes**: field-level incompatibilities resolved for v2 protocol
- **Dynamic permission mode**: permission mode changes via RPC during active sessions
- **Codex context restore**: `/duplicate` restores context using `thread/resume` with path
- **Tool name normalization**: `normalizeToolName` aligns MCP tool names with Codex convention

## Voice Assistant (Happy Voice)

Happy Next includes a complete voice gateway stack built on the Volcano AI / Happy Voice gateway.

- **Volcano AI–powered voice gateway** (`happy-voice`) with pluggable providers
- **Provider auto-switching by prefix**: `openai/gpt-4.1-mini` for LLM, `cartesia/sonic-3:voiceId` for TTS, `assemblyai/universal-streaming:en` for STT
- **Microphone mute** in voice conversations (Happy Voice)
- **Voice tools**: session management (navigate, end conversation), message sending
- **Voice message send confirmation** with configurable countdown
- **"Thinking" indicator** in voice status bar
- **Context-aware voice**: full app state (sessions, git status, etc.) injected as structured context
- **Silero VAD sensitivity** tuning via environment variables
- **Speech fragment merging** for interrupted user turns
- **Configurable welcome message** from app settings
- **System prompt engineering**: English prompts, semantic XML separation, inline LLM hints
- **Read-aloud for AI replies**: a one-shot `POST /v1/voice/tts` endpoint synthesizes a message's text (reusing the configured `AGENT_TTS` provider) and the app plays it from a voice button in the message footer, with single-message-at-a-time playback

## Multi-Repo Worktree Workspaces

A major new capability: manage multiple repositories as a unified workspace.

- **Create workspaces** with multiple repos from the new session wizard
- **RepoPickerBar** and **RepoSelector** components for workspace creation and switching

- **Git status aggregation** across all workspace repos
- **Auto-generate workspace `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md`** with `@import` references
- **Workspace lifecycle management**: metadata tracking, git operations, archive/cleanup via daemon RPC
- **Worktree merge and PR creation** with target branch selection
- **AI-powered PR code review**: one-click launch of an AI session to review a PR, results posted as a GitHub PR comment
- **Path display** with `~/` notation instead of absolute paths

## Code Browser & Git Management

The app now includes a full code browsing and git management experience.

- **File browser** with directory navigation and search (current directory filter + project-wide)
- **File viewer** with Monaco editor (readonly mode for viewing, edit mode for changes)
- **Commit history** with branch selector (local and remote branches)
- **Commit detail page** with diff viewing and action buttons (copy hash, copy message)

## Session Sharing

Share AI coding sessions with others through direct invites or public links, with full end-to-end encryption.

- **Direct sharing** with NaCl Box end-to-end encryption via uploaded content public keys
- **Public link sharing** with token-derived key encryption
- **Access levels**: view-only, edit, and admin permissions with server-side enforcement
- **Real-time sync**: messages, git status, and voice chat broadcast to all shared users via socket events
- **"All / Shared with me / Shared by me" filter tabs** in session list
- **Share indicator** on sessions shared with others
- **Sharer avatar** and **sender name** display in shared sessions

- **Access logging** for public share views

## OpenClaw Integration

Connect to external AI machines through a gateway system with its own chat interface.

## AI Backend Profiles

Configure alternative LLM backends for Claude Code through environment variable profiles.

- **Environment variable mapping**: automatically maps provider-specific env vars (e.g. `DEEPSEEK_*` → `ANTHROPIC_*`)
- **Custom profiles**: create profiles with arbitrary environment variables and `${VAR:-default}` expansion
- **Per-profile settings**: tmux session name, startup scripts, default permission mode, agent type compatibility

## Self-Hosting

Happy Next adds a first-class self-hosting path.

- **Root `docker-compose.yml`** with all services: Web app (Nginx), API server, Voice gateway, Postgres, Redis, MinIO
