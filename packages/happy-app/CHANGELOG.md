# Changelog

## Version 8 - 2026-04-17

OpenClaw chat now renders rich AI content blocks, plus Claude Opus 4.7 model support.

- OpenClaw: full rendering of thinking, tool use, and image content blocks from external AI machines
- Models: add Claude Opus 4.7 to available model list
- Image uploads: raise max dimension to 1568px and skip redundant compression when originals are already within limits, preserving text sharpness in code and UI screenshots

## Version 7 - 2026-03-18

Orchestrator arrives — define multi-agent task DAGs and let Happy schedule, execute, and monitor them automatically, plus offline message queuing, session management upgrades, and dozens of reliability fixes.

- Orchestrator: define task dependency graphs (DAGs) with per-task model and working directory, auto-schedule execution across Claude, Codex, and Gemini, monitor progress with real-time status badges, and follow up on completed tasks via session resume.
- Pending message queue: messages sent while the CLI is busy are queued server-side and auto-dispatched when ready, with a queue panel UI, image count badges, and send-now option.
- Session management: Active/Inactive tab filter replaces the old toggle, device and agent filter dropdowns in history, session preview expand/collapse, metadata caching for faster listing, and CLI hot-upgrade support.
- File viewer: image preview with sharing support directly from the code browser.
- CLI: daemon auto-start on boot (`happy daemon enable`), restart command, Codex v0.116.0 with fast mode, message receipt tracking, and attribution setting (default off).
- DooTask: globalized WebSocket connection with real-time task updates, related task entry in session info, and persistent server-side connection.
- MCP tools: `preview_html` for full-page HTML preview, dual-mode long-press copy in tool details, and colon-separated tool naming support.
- Gemini and Codex compatibility: ACP result format normalization, tool ID prefix fallback matching, Codex v2 protocol fixes, and dynamic permission mode changes.
- 50+ bug fixes across session sharing, feed lifecycle, toast positioning, icon font preloading, markdown rendering, and git status reliability.

## Version 6 - 2026-03-04

The biggest Happy update ever — multi-agent, voice, workspaces, code browser, DooTask, session sharing, and self-hosting all land in one release, plus 200+ bug fixes across the board.

- Full multi-agent support: Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini are now equal first-class agents with session resume, duplicate/fork, per-agent model selection, and accurate cost tracking.
- LiveKit-based voice assistant with pluggable STT/LLM/TTS providers, microphone mute, thinking indicator, and context-aware conversations that understand your full app state.
- Multi-repo worktree workspaces: create workspaces spanning multiple repositories, manage branches per-repo, auto-generate CLAUDE.md, and create PRs with AI-powered code review.
- Built-in code browser with file navigation, Monaco editor, commit history, branch selector, and a full git changes page for staging, committing, and discarding changes.
- Session sharing: share sessions with friends via direct invite (NaCl Box E2E encryption) or public links (token-derived keys), with real-time sync, access control, and a public share web viewer.
- DooTask integration with task lists, detail pages, real-time WebSocket chat, emoji reactions, voice message playback, one-click AI session launch, and in-app task/project creation.
- OpenClaw gateway for connecting to external AI machines with secure Ed25519 key exchange, real-time streaming chat, and relay or direct connection modes.
- AI backend profiles with built-in presets for DeepSeek, Z.AI, OpenAI, Azure, and Google AI — switch LLM backends for Claude Code with custom environment variable mapping.
- Self-hosting with a single `docker-compose` command: Web app, API server, Voice gateway, Postgres, Redis, and MinIO all configured out of the box.
- Major sync reliability improvements: v3 messages API with seq-based sync, HTTP outbox for offline delivery, server-confirmed sends, and message loss prevention.
- Chat UX polish: image attachment and clipboard paste, message pagination, unread blue dot indicator, compact view, session search, /duplicate command, pull-to-refresh, and improved markdown tables.
- CLI: `happy update` self-upgrade command, `happy --version` displays all agent versions, worktree subdirectory detection.

## Version 5 - 2025-12-22

This release expands AI agent support and refines the voice experience, while improving markdown rendering for a better chat experience.

- We are working on adding Gemini support using ACP and hopefully fixing codex stability issues using the same approach soon! Stay tuned.
- Removed model configurations from agents. We were not able to keep up with the models so for now we are removing the configuration from the mobile app. You can still configure it through your CLIs, happy will simply use defaults.
- Elevenlabs ... is epxensive. Voice conversations will soon require a subscription after 3 free trials - we'll soon allow connecting your own ElevenLabs agent if you want to manage your own spendings.
- Improved markdown table rendering in chat - no more ASCII pipes `|--|`, actual formatted tables (layout still needs work, but much better!)
