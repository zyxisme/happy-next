## How does it work?

On your computer, run `happy` instead of `claude`, `happy codex` instead of `codex`, or `happy gemini` instead of `gemini` to start your AI through our wrapper. When you want to control your coding agent from your phone, it restarts the session in remote mode. To switch back to your computer, just press any key on your keyboard.

## What’s new in Happy Next

Happy Next is a major evolution of the original Happy. Here are the highlights:

### Orchestrator
- Define task dependency graphs (DAGs) with per-task model and working directory
- Auto-schedule execution across Claude, Codex, and Gemini agents
- Real-time status badges, activity count, and status-colored progress bars
- Follow up on completed tasks via session resume
- MCP tool integration with auto-filled working directory

### Pending Message Queue
- Messages sent while the CLI is busy are queued server-side and auto-dispatched
- Queue panel UI with image count badges and send-now option
- Reconnect sync and concurrent dispatch safety

### Multi-Agent (Claude Code + Codex + Gemini)
- All three agents are first-class citizens with session resume, duplicate/fork, and history
- Multi-agent history page with per-provider tabs, device and agent filter dropdowns
- Per-agent model selection, cost tracking, and context window display
- ACP and App-Server (JSON-RPC) backends for Codex, Codex v0.130.0 with fast mode
- AI backend profiles with presets for DeepSeek, Z.AI, OpenAI, Azure, and Google AI
- Claude Opus 4.8 support with empty thinking block filtering for clean 4.x rendering
- GPT-5.5 support for Codex with low/medium/high/xhigh reasoning levels
- Gemini 3.1 Pro and Gemini 3 Flash (GA) in the model catalog; wizard handles flash model variants

### Voice Assistant (Happy Voice)
- Volcano (火山引擎 / Doubao) real-time gateway powering speech-to-text, LLM, and text-to-speech, replacing the earlier LiveKit / ElevenLabs stack
- Native in-call voice on iOS with streaming text-to-speech, connection state gated on room-state changes, and the microphone guarded during a call
- Selectable voice timbre and speech rate; multilingual replies default to the seed-tts-2.0 voice
- Smarter LLM text cleaning before speech — trivial short text skips cleaning to cut latency, with localized in-call announcements
- Voice assistant configuration syncs across devices via end-to-end-encrypted user settings
- Microphone mute, voice message send confirmation, "thinking" indicator
- Context-aware voice: app state is injected into the voice LLM automatically
- Read any AI reply aloud with a one-tap voice button in the message footer (one-shot text-to-speech via the voice gateway)
- Manage sessions by voice — start, switch, and message a session through dedicated voice tools with a single session-settings mode parameter, clearer titles, and an auto-close countdown on the session-picker cancel button

### Multi-Repo Worktree Workspaces
- Create, switch, and archive multi-repo workspaces from the app
- Per-repo branch selection, settings, and scripts
- Aggregated git status across repos
- Auto-generate workspace `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` with `@import` refs
- Worktree merge and PR creation with target branch selection
- AI-powered PR code review with results posted as GitHub comments

### Code Browser & Git Management
- Full file browser with search, Monaco editor viewing/editing
- Commit history with branch selector (local + remote)
- Git changes page: stage, unstage, commit, discard
- Per-file diff stats (+N/-N) for Claude, Codex, and Gemini
- Image preview with sharing support
- Commits list tags the commit at the upstream branch tip

### Session Sharing
- Share sessions with friends via direct invite or public link
- End-to-end encrypted: NaCl Box (direct) and token-derived keys (public links)
- Real-time sync of messages, git status, and voice chat across shared users
- Access control with view, edit, and admin permission levels
- "All / Shared with me / Shared by me" filter tabs and share indicator in session list
- Public share web viewer for link-based access

### OpenClaw Gateway
- Connect to external AI machines via relay tunnel or direct WebSocket
- Machine pairing with Ed25519 key exchange
- Chat interface with real-time streaming and session management
- Rich content block rendering: thinking, tool use, and image blocks from external AI

### DooTask Integration
- Task list with filters, search, pagination, and status workflows
- Task detail with HTML rendering, assignees, files, sub-tasks
- Real-time WebSocket chat (Slack-style layout, emoji reactions, voice playback, images/video)
- One-click AI session launch from any task (MCP server passthrough)
- Create tasks and projects directly from the app with cross-platform date picker
- Globalized WebSocket connection with real-time task updates and persistent server-side connection
- DooTask recents merged into the main inbox with persistent cache and silent background refresh
- Session avatars on DooTask-related sessions, chat header adapts to dialog type

### Self-Hosting
- One-command `docker-compose up` (Web + API + Voice + Postgres + Redis + MinIO)
- Separate origins architecture (no path reverse proxy)
- `.env.example` with full configuration reference
- Runtime env var injection for Docker builds
- Zero-cost nginx `/healthz` endpoint for load-balancer / uptime probes

### Sync & Reliability
- v3 messages API with seq-based sync, batch writes, and cursor pagination
- HTTP outbox for reliable delivery when WebSocket is unavailable
- Server-confirmed message sending with retry and message receipt tracking
- Fixes for cursor skip, outbox race, message duplication/loss
- Chat reducer no longer synthesizes out-of-order completed-permission messages
- Message send hardened for flaky networks; draft restore is suppressed while a send is in flight
- Session loading reliability: 60s message-fetch timeout, recovery from permanent load failure, refresh indicator across the entire retry loop, and chunked base64 encoding to avoid stack overflow on very large payloads
- Session draft rewritten as a single source of truth — fewer cases of drafts vanishing or reappearing

### Chat & Session UX
- Image attachment and clipboard paste (web), image support in drafts, high-quality pass-through up to 1568px preserving text sharpness in code/UI screenshots
- Session titles seeded from the first user message for new sessions (until an AI summary takes over)
- Slash command results surface even when the agent emits no assistant message (e.g. unknown commands no longer blank out)
- Slash-command autocomplete shows each command's source scope (repo / user / plugin / system) and kind; session capabilities are stored separately from metadata and sync live so command and skill lists stay fresh
- `/duplicate` command to fork a session from any message, including directly from an AI reply
- Sending shows an optimistic "Processing…" status immediately, plus a "refreshing" indicator while the message list reloads
- Message pagination, unread blue dot indicator, compact list view
- Active/Inactive tab filter, session preview expand/collapse, metadata caching
- Recent session history pagination for faster initial load
- Session rename with lock (prevent AI auto-update), search in history
- Options click-to-send / long-press-to-fill, scroll-to-bottom button
- "Always show context size" defaults to on so usage is visible without opening session details
- Per-message action bar with copy, fork-from-here (with progress spinner), read-aloud, and full timestamp on web hover / native tap
- Web desktop: hover-to-show copy button on chat messages and right-click on options reusing the mobile long-press behavior
- Mobile text selection: in-app selection page uses browser-native long-press with static syntax highlighting (Lezer) for reliable first-tap selection on Android
- Pull-to-refresh, inset dividers, Agent tool display with robot icon
- Tool input/output formatted as key-value pairs instead of raw JSON
- `preview_html` tool for full-page HTML preview, colon-separated MCP tool naming
- CLI hot-upgrade support mid-session
- Path picker with directory autocomplete via remote machine listing (web + mobile)
- Session header unified across iOS / Android / web with left-aligned title, new-session button on the header right, and a header title in the session info screen
- Long user messages (>20k characters) collapse to a preview with a Show More toggle; text selection inside messages on web is fixed

### CLI
- `happy update` self-upgrade, `happy --version` with all agent versions
- Daemon auto-start on boot (`happy daemon enable/disable`), restart command
- Unified system prompt injection for Codex and Gemini
- Message receipt tracking with legacy compatibility
- Permission-mode switches from the app forward synchronously to the running Claude subprocess (no longer wait until the next message)

### Bug Fixes & Stability
- 250+ bug fixes: message sending reliability, session lifecycle, Markdown rendering, navigation, voice, DooTask, sharing
- Security: shell command injection fix, plan mode permission handling
- Performance: payload trimming for mobile, lazy-load diffs, rendering optimization, incremental session catch-up on open

### UI & Polish
- Native platform-feel mobile UX: iOS / Android use the platform-native bottom tab bar and native header on home, chat, and inbox screens
- Inbox-first bottom tab order, "Session" tab label, dedicated navigation icons (no more brutalist placeholders)
- iOS polish: chevron-only back button, header avatar geometry/clipping fixes, centered native header title, centralized status bar controller
- iOS 26 fixes: scroll-edge fade suppression, full-screen translucent chat overlay with keyboard, prompt modal presentation
- iPad / Mac windowed-mode polish: sidebar header reserves space for window controls, fixed session header resize, top-tab insets, list divider rendering, and windowed keyboard overlap
- Web: bottom tab bundling fix, session header navigation fix, path autocomplete focus handling
- Dark mode fixes throughout the app
- i18n improvements (Chinese Simplified/Traditional, CJK input handling)
- Markdown rendering: tables, inline code, nested fences, clickable file paths
- Keyboard handling, loading states, navigation stability, icon font preloading

## Compatibility note

Happy Next intentionally changed client KDF labels as part of the rebrand. Treat this as a **new generation**: do not expect encrypted data created by older clients to be readable by Happy Next (and vice versa).

## 🏠 Who We Are

We build Happy Next because we want to supervise coding agents from anywhere (web/mobile) without giving up control, privacy, or the option to self-host.
